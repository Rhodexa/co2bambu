# Bambu CO2
 Bambu (Breathing Air Measuring Boxy Unit) is an air quality logging system designed for ESP8266 MCU using the SCD30 NDIR module.
 <br>This project is a complete replanning of the sesnor designed by **Instituto Balseiro** <br>
 https://github.com/droyktton/medidorCO2 <br>
 Which had many problems such as low portability, high price, short battery life, wrong calibration procedures, slow reaction, inappropriate UI, low readability, inefficient code, and unnecessary circuit complexity.
 
 Features considered in this project:
 <br>• Lower the price while increasing performance.
 <br>• WiFi connectivity (Maybe with an IoT aim) to read and download logs
 <br>• Excel-compatible exports
 <br>• QR Codes to allow for quick access
 <br>• Intuitive UI for general public
 <br>• Cheap and small design (not counting the SCD30)
 <br>• Portability in mind
 <br>• Automation compatible (automatic window and air circulation control, for instance)
 <br>• Integrated design, no need for extra tools (Self contained web app)
 <br>• Interconnectivity mode for centralized administration of large buildings (such as schools)
 <br>• Useful, not annoying (No unnecessary beeping)
 <br>• Readable display (OLED instead of LCD)
 <br> <br>
 This project was created for the **Center of Technical Education 21** (CET21) <br> Catriel, RN, Argentina.
 <br> Naming may change in the future, as well as the whole core, plus, maintance is not planned to last much. This repository might get turn down or donated by the end of 2022.
